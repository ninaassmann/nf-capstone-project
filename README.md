My capstone project entails the development of a comprehensive pet management application designed to effortlessly oversee your beloved companions. This innovative app empowers users to create personalized profiles for each of their pets, facilitating the organization of crucial details. From vaccinations and dietary preferences to microchip identification and weight monitoring, the app serves as a centralized hub for all essential pet-related information.

In times of urgency, the app also allows users to designate their veterinarian as an emergency contact, ensuring swift accessibility when needed the most.

Moreover, the application goes beyond conventional pet management by incorporating a feature that aids in reuniting lost pets with their owners. Whether a pet is missing or found, this functionality fosters a seamless connection between pets and their caretakers.

Additionally, an expansive information repository is envisioned, offering users a wealth of knowledge about diverse pet breeds. This resourceful section serves as a valuable reference for pet enthusiasts seeking insights into various breeds, their characteristics, and care requirements.
