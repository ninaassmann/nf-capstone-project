My capstone project entails the development of a comprehensive pet management application designed to effortlessly oversee your beloved companions. This innovative app empowers users to create personalized profiles for each of their pets, facilitating the organization of crucial details. The app serves as a centralized hub for all essential pet-related information.

In times of urgency, the app also allows users to designate their veterinarian as an emergency contact, ensuring swift accessibility when needed the most.

Additionally, an expansive information repository is envisioned, offering users a wealth of knowledge about diverse pet breeds. This resourceful section serves as a valuable reference for pet enthusiasts seeking insights into various breeds, their characteristics, and care requirements.
